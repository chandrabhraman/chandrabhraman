**ChandraBhraman** \n
A lunar guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) researcher, I have worked on developing systems and technologies that allow spacecraft and other vehicles to navigate and control their movement on the surface of the Moon or in its orbit. This involved designing algorithms and software for navigation, developing sensors model and other hardware for guidance and control, and testing and validating these systems through simulations or field experiments. I’m interested in sharing my work and looking for collaborating with projects comprising the latest advancements in GNC for moon.
