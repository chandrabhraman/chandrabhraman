- 👋 Hi, I’m @chandrabhraman
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing Guidance Navigation and Control resources for everyone. As a lunar guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) researcher, I focus on developing and improving systems and technologies that allow spacecraft and other vehicles to navigate and control their movement on the surface of the Moon or in its orbit. This can involve designing algorithms and software for navigation, developing sensors and other hardware for guidance and control, and testing and validating these systems through simulations or field experiments.

GNC research is a critical aspect of lunar exploration, as it allows spacecraft and other vehicles to accurately and safely navigate to, and operate within, the lunar environment. It also plays a key role in enabling various scientific and technological missions on the Moon, such as sample collection, resource exploration, and communication with Earth.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects comprising the latest advancements in GNC for moon
